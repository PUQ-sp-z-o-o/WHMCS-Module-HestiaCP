### 5. WHMCS configuration

>Attention! Let's Encrypt certificate generation takes longer than any other request.  
In order to avoid the "Troubleshooting an Argument 1 passed ... must be an instance of PDOStatement Error" error, some configuration changes must be made.

Let's go to:

```
nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

The changes are by 30 sec or more:

```
wait_timeout=30
long_query_time=30
```

After changing the configuration, you need to restart the service:

```
service mysql restart
```
