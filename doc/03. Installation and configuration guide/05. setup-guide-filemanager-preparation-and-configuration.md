# 1. Simple installation Filemanager

### 1. Prepare hosting for the file manager.

>**Minimum Requirements:** PHP 7.2.5+ (with php-zip extension)

### 2. Download the latest version filemanager from the module folder.

```
wget http://download.puqcloud.com/WHMCS/servers/PUQ_WHMCS-HestiaCP/filemanager/filemanager.zip
```

>All versions are available via link: [http://download.puqcloud.com/WHMCS/servers/PUQ\_WHMCS-HestiaCP/filemanager/](http://download.puqcloud.com/WHMCS/servers/PUQ_WHMCS-HestiaCP/filemanager/)

### 2. Unzip the archive with the Filemanager and upload them to your PHP server

```
unzip filemanager.zip
```

### 3. Make sure your webserver can read and write to `../repository/` and `../private/` folders

### 4. Set the website document root to `../dist/` directory. This is also known as 'public' folder

>**NOTE:** For security reasons `filegator/dist` is the ONLY folder you want to be exposed through the web. Everything else should be outside of your web root, this way people can’t access any of your important files through the browser. If you run the script from the root folder, you will see the message 'Development mode' as a security warning.

# 2. Advanced installation Filemanager

### 1. Installing a file manager

>The original instructions for installing and configuring the file manager [https://docs.filegator.io/install.html](https://docs.filegator.io/install.html)

>Minimum Requirements: PHP 7.2.5+ (with php-zip extension)

### Download precompiled build

Precompiled build is created for non-developers. In this version, the frontend (html, css and javascript) is compiled for you and the source code is removed so the final archive contains only minimum files.

 - Download the [latest release](https://github.com/filegator/static/raw/master/builds/filegator_latest.zip)
 - Unzip files and upload them to your PHP server
 - Make sure your webserver can read and write to `filegator/repository/` and `filegator/private/` folders
 - Set the website document root to `filegator/dist/` directory. This is also known as 'public' folder
 - Visit web page, if something goes wrong check `filegator/private/logs/app.log`

>NOTE: For security reasons `filegator/dist` is the ONLY folder you want to be exposed through the web. Everything else should be outside of your web root, this way people can’t access any of your important files through the browser. If you run the script from the root folder, you will see the message **'Development mode'** as a security warning.

### Install on fresh Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10.3

```
apt update
apt install -y wget unzip php apache2 libapache2-mod-php php-zip php-mbstring php-dom php-xml
